# PaddleBoard

## Purpose

A deep learning model is complex and can be difficult to understand or debug. It can feel like a black box to PaddlePaddle users. PaddleBoard is the flashlight to shine what is under the hood!

In order to help users to understand, optimize, and debug their PaddlePaddle program, we want to build a vidualization tool that can give insight into the computational graph architecture and data.


## Ideas / Proposals

### Key Features

- A diagram that displays entire model including operators, variables and layers
- A graph that keep tracks of metrics/data over time 


### Improvement from Tensorboard / Long term proposals 

- Side by side code and graph relationship (pointing to a certain op that can highlight the corresponding code)
- Make the board a lightweight IDE that able to run the program with custom parameters and see dynamically changing in visual graphs
- Simply drag and drop to draw the visual diagram and auto generate the code for non programmers, providing a UI to upload all the training data
- Bring something like TensorFlow Playground concepts into board
